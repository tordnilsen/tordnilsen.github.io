At Nasjonalmuseet, I lead initiatives that leverage AI to make our museum collections more accessible and engaging. I'm particularly involved in digital innovation projects, developing open APIs and creating digital experiences that are centered around the user.</p>
        
        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>My role is not just about preserving our cultural legacy; it's about bringing it to life in the digital realm, ensuring that it resonates with and is accessible to everyone.</p>
